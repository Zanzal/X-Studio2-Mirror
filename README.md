X-Studio2-Mirror
================
The official repo for X-Studio 2 is located at:
https://code.google.com/p/xstudio2/

This code was obtained under the MIT License and is an unofficial copy of Mr. Bear's original X-Studio 2 source repo. I've made this copy in the hopes that I will find some time to address the bugs that make the X-Studio 2 beta unusable.
