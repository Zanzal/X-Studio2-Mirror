X-Studio2-Mirror
================
The official repo for X-Studio 2 is located at:
https://code.google.com/p/xstudio2/

This code was obtained under the MIT License and is an unofficial copy of Mr. Bear's original X-Studio 2 source repo. I've made in the hopes that I will find some time to address the issues
copied his repo in the hopes of being able to fix some of the bugs that make the current version of X-Studio 2 unusable.
